## [Draft] Human User Guide

### ðŸ“Ž Template 
Keep the responses condense and short. Youâ€™re writing a user manual, not a novel. Feel free to use bullet points to answer these so itâ€™s easier to digest, especially if you work as part of a big team.

Here are six prompts to get you going. These are examples taken from 1 source. Additional examples are in the next section. Please use any and all elements you prefer.

1. Introduction
Give a brief overview of who you are, where you come from, and your career history. You donâ€™t need to share your whole life story. Focus on the elements you think will be helpful for your teammates to know. You come from Italy and worked there for a few years before moving to the US? Thatâ€™s great information. More personal or intimate details? Probably better to leave it out of your human user guide, and to share instead over drinks or coffee with the colleagues that have shared that they are open and available for more personal conversations.

2. Environment
What are your ideal conditions to work in? When do you do your best work? While most jobs are a combination of collaboration and solo work, some people really enjoy working on their own, and may want to include it in their personal user manual so teammates know to only pull them into the most important meetings. Maybe you also enjoy working late and may not want to have commitments early in the morning.

3. Communication
This section is about the best ways to communicate with you. Whatâ€™s the best way to reach you in case something is urgent? Are you more of a Slack or email person? Do you check your email once a day or can you be reached there at all time? Is it okay to message you via the companyâ€™s chat for non-urgent matters? Are you comfortable with video calls?

4. Feedback
Share how you like to receive feedback. While some people like to get rapid feedback, others like to have some time to mull over a problem before getting input from others. Similarly, some people like to sit down and talk through things, while others are happy to receive quick bullet points with comments and suggestions.

5. Support
Share how people can help you and how you can help other people. If you have any particular strengths or weaknesses, this is the section to add them to. When it comes to weaknesses, try to make it about personal growthâ€”instead of stating that youâ€™re bad at something, say that you would like to improve in that specific area.

6. Favorites
This is a fun section to share your favourite quotes, books, podcasts, blogs, or anything that can give people a better sense of your personal interests.
