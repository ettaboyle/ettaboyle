I thrive in fast-paced environments, and love working with creative, driven teams to achieve big ambitious goals. I enjoy campaign strategy & design, content development, program management, community management, champion programs, and brand management.

üéß **Focus Time**: I need focus blocks with little to no distractions at various points in the week. I'm pretty good about blocking these on my calendar, and noting them in my slack status. That being said - If I have a focus block and you need an urgent response please don't hesitate to DM me on Slack

üè¢ **Office**: I prefer to come into the office rather than WFH. If you're in the GitHub Bellevue office come say hi! üëãüèª I sit on the west side of the 20th floor. 

#### ‚òéÔ∏è Communication

#### üîÑ Feedback
- **Candor**: I am open and accepting to direct feedback and give honest and supportive feedback and guidance to my team and peers. I am not afraid of difficult conversations.
- **Rapid Processing**: I often "get" interpersonal and conceptual things fast. If I need further guidance or clarification I will ask for it, but I am often right with someone and ready to go. I am aware that there is a risk here that this can appear as folding to someone else's direction, so I am actively working to validate that I understand what has been communicated before moving on.
- **Inspirtaion**: Jed Bartlett ala [The West Wing](https://screenrant.com/west-wing-quotes/#:~:text=1%20%22What's%20Next%3F%22%20%2D%20President%20Bartlet&text=It's%20a%20motivational%20quote%20that,momentum%20of%20the%20team%20going) - "_What's Next_" - _It's a motivational quote that his team learns to understand that these two words mean he's ready to move on to the next task and it keeps the momentum of the team going.._
